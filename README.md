# Bot-Controller
A controller interface for CWAD twitter bot.

# Tutorial

First thing to note is that this is just a like a console for you to post something on twitter remotely.
We will be using flask to do this relatively simple task. I have already uploaded a completed example in
the master branch so you can test it out. However, if you want to do it yourself, I suggest you start from
scratch by recreating the whole project structure. I want you to get used to the layout of this to get a 
better understanding of the backend code. 

Make the project directory like this:

/root_dir

---controller/
